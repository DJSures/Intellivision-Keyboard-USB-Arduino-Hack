# Intellivision-Keyboard-USB-Arduino-Hack
Convert the Intellivision keyboard into a USB HID device using an Arduino Micro. I hacked my Intellivision to have a Raspberry Pi running Retro Pie and the controllers are Arduino USB as well. This keyboard hack allows me to use it with the hacked Intellivision rather than using a newer style usb keyboard.
